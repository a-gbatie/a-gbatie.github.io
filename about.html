        Ange-Gaëlle is currently a Software Engineer with Cisco, her journey transitioning into the tech industry began in 2019. She initally graduated with a degree in Photography, but found it did not fufill her desire for problem solving. In this line of work, she is able to unite both sides of her love for creativity & her love for analytical thinking, as well as have the flexibility to travel the world while not being tied to a desk. Ange's future plans include using her programming skills to create a software that can directly help with the nation's homeless crisis and other philanthropic endeavors. 
        
        Outside of work you can find her listening to a true crime podcast, reading, watching anime, or listening to music; she loves to travel and experience new cultures.

    <p>"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? ...As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others." </p>
    <p>- Marianne Williamson</p>

    <p>I am homesick for a place I am not sure even exists. One where my heart is full. My body loved. And my soul understood.</p>
